This project introduces a dynamic and user-friendly "WordQuest" created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced by the integration of Dictionary-API and Quotable API. The primary goal of this website is to provide users with an efficient platform for exploring and understanding words, their meanings, pronunciations, and contextual usage.

The website features a robust search functionality allowing users to input words and receive detailed information, including accurate definitions, pronunciation guides, and illustrative examples. The integration of Dictionary-API ensures a vast and reliable database for comprehensive word exploration. Additionally, the Quotable-API is employed to enrich the user experience by incorporating inspirational and relevant quotes related to searched words.

Beyond the search functionality, the website includes a bookmark feature, enabling users to save their favorite words or those of particular interest for future reference. This personalized aspect enhances the user experience, making the website a valuable tool for language enthusiasts and learners.

To enhance user engagement, the project also incorporates a recent search indication, displaying a list of the most recently searched words. This feature facilitates easy navigation and encourages users to revisit previously explored content.
